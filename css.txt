what is css?
css(cascading style sheet) is a language use to style an html document how it should be displayed.

##css selectors
* : universal selector
class: selects the element with specific class name
id: selects an element with an specific id name
element: selects an specific element

## text styling
font-size: sets the size of text
color: sets the color of the text
font-style: sets the font style
font-family: sets the font family(eg: font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;)

CSS colors
background-color:sets the background color for html elements
bordercolor:sets the color of border(bordor:1px solid red)
{rgb(0,0,1),
rgba(0,0,1,0.8)}
background-image: specifies an image to use as the background of an element
background-repeat: keeps the image with norepeat(default repeat)


float
 this property  floats the elements.
        (float:left): floats elements towards left
        (float:right): floats elements towards right
        float: none: default
        float:inherit: float like the parent does
 clear
  this property clears the floating elements on the direction that is set to clear
        clear:right- doesnot allow any element to float on its right
        clear:left-  doesnot allow any element to float on its left      
        clear:both- doesnot allow any element to float on its both side       
       clear:none- default
       clear: inherit- inherits the clear value as parent
 
 display:         
 sets how the elements should be displayed on the screen( eg display: inline, inlineblock , block, grid, flex)
   inline- displays element on inline 
   block- display elemnts as block element
   flex- displays elements as flex container(types: flex-row/flex-column/flex-rowreverse/flex-columnreverse)
   grid- displays elements as grid container(in a design rowwise we make a different style with the help of row and column)
   inlineblock- creates the block elements in inline container
   table- lets the elements behave like table

Property	             |Description
column-gap              |	Specifies the gap between the columns
gap	                  | specifies the gap between two element
grid-column	            | A shorthand property for the grid-column-start and the grid-column-end properties
grid-column-end         |	Specifies where to end the grid item
grid-column-start       |	Specifies where to start the grid item
grid-row                |	A shorthand property for the grid-row-start and the grid-row-end properties
grid-row-end            |	Specifies where to end the grid item
grid-row-start          |	Specifies where to start the grid item
grid-template           |	A shorthand property for the grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns and grid-areas properties
grid-template-areas	    | Specifies how to display columns and rows, using named grid items
grid-template-columns	| Specifies the size of the columns, and how many columns in a grid layout
grid-template-rows	    |Specifies the size of the rows in a grid layout
row-gap                 |	Specifies the gap between the grid rows

2D transform
  it allows you to move,rotate,scaleand skew elements
  translate():it moves an element from its current position(according to the parameters given for x-axis and the y-axis)
  rotate(): it roates an element clockwise or anticlockwise according to a given degree(rotate(90deg))
  scale(): it increases or decreaes the size of an element(according to the parameter given for the width and height)
  scalex(): it increases or decreases the width of an element
  scaley(): it increases or decreases the height of an element
  skewX(): it skews an element along x-axis by the given angle(skewX(20deg))
  skewY(): it skews an element along y-axis by the given angle(skewY(20deg))
  skew(): it skewsan element along x and y-axis by the given angle(skew(20deg,10deg))
  matrix():it it combines all 2D transform function into one{scaleX(),skewY(),skewX(),scaleY(),translateX(),translateY()}

  3D transforms
    it allows changing element using 3D transformations
    rotateX():it rotates an element around its x-axis at a given degree
    rotateY():it rotates an element around its y-axis at a given degree
    rotateZ():it rotates an element around its z axis at a given degree

    css transitions
     it allows you to change property values smoothly,over a given duration
     transition               : a shorthand property for setting the four transition properties into a single property
     transition-delay         : Specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect
     transition-duration      : Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds a transition effect takes to complete
      transition-property     : Specifies the name of the CSS property the transition effect is for
      transition-timing-function : Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect
      vlaues of transition-timing-functions:
      ease        : specifies a transition effect with slow start then fast then end slowly(this is default)
      linear      : specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
      ease-in     : specifies a transition effect with a slow start
      ease-out    : specifies a transition effect with a slow end
      ease-in-out : specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end(combination of ease in/out)

  css animations
   it changes the appearences and behavior of various elements in web pages
   @keyframes	Specifies the animation code
   animation	             : A shorthand property for setting all the animation properties
   animation-delay	       : Specifies a delay for the start of an animation
   animation-direction	       : Specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles
   animation-duration	       : Specifies how long time an animation should take to complete one cycle
   animation-fill-mode	       : Specifies a style for the element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both)
   animation-iteration-count   : Specifies the number of times an animation should be played
   animation-name              : Specifies the name of the @keyframes animation
   animation-play-state	       : Specifies whether the animation is running or paused
   animation-timing-function   : Specifies the speed curve of the animation

  The differnece between transition and animation is transitions provide a change from one state to another 
  while animations can set mutiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

  css box sizing
   it allows us to include padding and border in an elements total width and height
   actual width of an element=width+padding+border
   actual height of an element=height+padding+border
